Greetings.  I like green apples with cheese, olive bread with cheese, and cheese with dark chocolate. Once I ate a green apple with a piece of olive bread and some dark chocolate.  It was a mistake: a mistake that could have been easily rectified with a few slices of triple-cream brie, or perhaps a small wedge of Gouda.
